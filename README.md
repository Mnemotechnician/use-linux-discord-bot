# "Use Linux" discord bot
Sends a random ai-generated message that is supposed to tell you to use Linux every 4 hours. I am not responsible for any nonsense it may generate.

You can use the `/add-channel` command to opt-in, `/remove-channel` to opt-out.

You can invite the bot to your guild with via the following link:
